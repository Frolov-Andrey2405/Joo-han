# Joo-han
"Cho-han" is a traditional dice game popular in the gambling houses of feudal Japan. In this game, two six-sided dice are thrown from a cup, and players must guess whether the sum of the numbers will be even ("cho") or odd ("han"). The gambling house receives a small commission on each winning bet.
